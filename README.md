# Using Statistical Characterization and Deep Learning for Classification of Microscopy Images

This project aims to discover salient features of highly reflective (butterfly wings) and
highly absorptive (moth eyes) micro-structures. A range of methods for feature extraction, feature selection and classification will be utilized (*Fig. 1*).
